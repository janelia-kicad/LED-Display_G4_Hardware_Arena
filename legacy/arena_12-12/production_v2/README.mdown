# Production files

The `.art` files are GERBER RS274X files.

The `Assembly.art` file contains the constraints for production. For example, the copper layers are as follows: `TOP`, `PWR`, `LAYER_1`, `GND2`, `LAYER_2`, `BOTTOM`.

There are no paste layers, our engineer insists that it is the same as the solder mask layer.

* `Assembly.art` - Assembly instructions
* `drill_arena_12-12_v2_L1-L6` - Excellon Drill file between Layer 1 and Layer 6. Metric 3:3, auto-tool select, LZ, no repeat codes.
* `TOP.art` - top Cu Layer (Layer 1)
* `PWR.art` - Power Cu layer (Layer 2)
* `LAYER_1.art` - Logic Cu layer 1 (Layer 3)
* `GND2.art` - Ground Cu layer 2 (Layer 4)
* `LAYER_2.art` - Logic Cu layer 2 (Layer 5)
* `BOTTOM.art` - Bottom Cu layer (Layer 6)
* `silk_screen_top.art` - Top silkscreen
* `silk_screen_bottom.art` - Bottom silkscreen
* `Solder_Mask_Bottom.art` - bottom solder mask
* `Solder_Mask_Top.art` - top solder mask
* `placement_body-center.txt` - placement file, using the body center of components, modified format (If manufacturer doesn't specify which placement file, they most likely want this one.)
* `placement_pin1.txt` - centroid placement for the pin 1 location of each component
* `placement_symbol-origin.txt` - centroid placement file
* `BOM.xlsx` - Bill of Materials
* `README.mdown` - this file

# Changelog

* 2022-12-05: minor addition to BOM. v2.4
* 2022-11-30: merge between v2.1, feedback we received from a Bittele production, and updates from jET. Renamed previous version 2.2 (notched) to v6.0 to avoid confusion. Create new v2.3
