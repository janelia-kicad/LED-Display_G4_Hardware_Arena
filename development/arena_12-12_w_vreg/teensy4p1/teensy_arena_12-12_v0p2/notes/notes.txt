panel header pin distance from front

D = PCB + HDR1 + HDR2 - 0.5*HDR3

where

PCB  = thickness of PCB (1.6mm)
HDR1 = distance from PCB to top of insulation for 2x2 headers on driver (3.81mm)
HDR2 = distance from PCB to top of insulation for 2x2 headers on comm (8.5mm)
HDR3 = distance from PCB to pin in 15-pos header on comm (0.5*2.54mm)


D = 1.6 + 3.81 + 8.5 + 0.5*2.54 = 12.01mm
